**Gallery** is a node js plugin for maintaining static assets for any project.

Why use gallery:
- Easier to manage static assets such as icons, images etc with a web preview.
- Better developer experience by making sure developers don't have to search entire folder in code editor to search for assets.
- Making sure your repo dont end up having multiple duplicate assets.
- Better control with a custom config file.
- Trust me there are many more...
